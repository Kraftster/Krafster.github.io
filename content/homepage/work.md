**My vision is to end the stigma of mental health through a person centered, solution focused and strength based approach. I believe that through genuine connections, we can break down the barriers that hold individuals back from living their most fulfilling life. I have had the opportunity to volunteer with Support House for the last 8 months as a Peer Intern which has allowed me to utilize additional skills taught in the SSW program. I am a creative individual with a very outgoing personality and passion to help others through their own journey. Life is a mysterious journey and I have been exploring opportunities in both Intake and Peer Work while learning additional skills that bring out my best potential.**
